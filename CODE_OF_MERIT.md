# Code of Merit

1. Contributions related to the project's code and continued development are
the paramount duty of the project's participants. All other activities within
the project are trivial in comparision. Those not within the scope of project
are irrelevant. 

2. The merit of contributions will be judged by their value to the project's,
either by their introduction and implementation of new featuresets and solutions, 
or their evolutive advantage over existing ones. 

3. Individual characteristics, both immutable and chosen, are irrelevant 
in the scope of the project  and will not be taken into account concerning 
your value or that of your contribution to the project, which will be 
judged on their merits or lack thereof.

4. The project creators/lead developers/core team are the overseers of the 
project and have ultimate decision-making power over the project in all 
respects they choose, be they technical, structural, organizational, 
personal or otherwise. 

5. Participation on the project equates to agreement of this Code of Merit.
